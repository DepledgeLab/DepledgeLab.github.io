description: "Amy has been awarded a fellowship at University College Dublin to develop novel ONT and bioinformatic methods for the discovery of novel RNA viruses. Amy's doctoral research centered on the development of High Throughput Sequencing methods for genotypic characterization of norovirus, encompassing both laboratory experiments and bioinformatics analysis. Currently, Amy is working on disentangling direct RNA ONT sequencing data, from parameter optimisation to assessing method consistency. Outside of the lab, she is an avid reader, yogi and Eurovision fanatic."
