description: "Carolin gained a Master's degree in Biology at TU Braunschweig before undertaking a PhD in the lab of PD Jens Bohne at the MHH. She received a DAAD PRIME fellowship that allowed her to join the lab of Prof. Britt Glaunsinger at 
UC Berkeley as a visiting postdoc before she later returned to the Bohne lab. In the Summer of 2021, she joined the Depledge Lab.
Carolin's current projects focus on understanding how the switch from latent to lytic replication in VZV takes place on the transcriptional level, and to identify RNA-binding proteins that bind to specific VZV transcripts.  
When not in the lab, Carolin likes being outdoors (hiking, biking,or running), spending time with friends and family, or reading a good book."
