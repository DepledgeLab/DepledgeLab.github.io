description: "Erik recieved his BSc in Biology from the Leibniz University of Hannover and is currently enrolled at the MHH Biomedical Data Science masters program. Currently his point of interest lies in studying the regulation of poly(A)-tail lengths and their sequence content under viral infection using computational approaches. If he's not currently exploring the world of bioinformatics he's likely exploiting it in (4X) strategy games."
