### Research in the Depledge lab focuses on several broad themes:

##### (1) Regulation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) latent-lytic switch in sensory neurons

We have previously shown that VZV transcription in latently infected human sensory ganglia is generally restricted to the [VZV latency transcript (VLT)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03569-2). The latent isoform of VLT comprises five exons and putatively encodes a protein (pVLT) although it is now known whether this is translated in latent infections. In iPSC-derived sensory neuronal models of VZV latency, we have since demonstrated that reactivation requires an alteration to 3'end processing in the VLT locus that results in alternative splicing and the addition of a sixth exon that encodes the VZV immediate-early transactivator ORF63. This novel transcript, termed [VLT63](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20031-4), is required for transactivation of the viral genome during reactivation from latency.

Our efforts are now focused on identifying and understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate 3' end processing in the VLT locus.




##### (1) Characterizing the roles of diverse base modifications (including m6A) on host and viral RNAs during productive infections

##### (2) Investigating the functions of herpesviral latency-associated transcripts and other non-coding RNAs (including miRNAs) during both lytic and latent infections

##### (3) Characterizing the transcriptional complexity of diverse viruses (herpesviruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses) in distinct cell types, such as epithelial cells and neurons.

**This is achieved through the integration of computational biology with a variety of high-throughput molecular techniques to study multiple aspects of virus-host interactions on a genome-wide scale. Specific targets of interest are subsequently followed up using classical molecular biology approaches.**
