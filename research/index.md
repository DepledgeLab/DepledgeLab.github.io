# Research summary

###Research in the Depledge lab focuses on several broad themes including:

####(1) Characterizing the roles of diverse base modifications (including m6A) on host and viral RNAs during productive infections

####(2) Investigating the functions of herpesviral latency-associated transcripts and other non-coding RNAs (including miRNAs) during both lytic and latent infections

####(3) Characterizing the transcriptional complexity of diverse viruses (herpesviruses, adenoviruses, coronaviruses) in distinct cell types, such as epithelial cells and neurons.

This is achieved through the integration of computational biology with a variety of high-throughput molecular techniques to study multiple aspects of virus-host interactions on a genome-wide scale. Specific targets of interest are subsequently followed up using classical molecular biology approaches.
