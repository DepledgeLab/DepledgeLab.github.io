### Master's students
We are proud to host students enrolled in the [MHH Biomedicine, Biomedical Data Science, and Infectious Disease + One Health (IDOH) programs](https://www.mhh.de/en/all-degree-programs) for both short (3-6 week) and long (up to 6 months) projects. If you are interested in discussing potential projects then please contact [Daniel Depledge](/contact).

### PhD Students

At the MHH, most PhD students are recruited via the DEWIN/ZIB (LINK) graduate program which offers a 3-year PhD program in which candidates who pass the interview stages are able to select from a set of projects submitted by group leaders from departments around the MHH. Scholarship awards (including DAAD(LINK)) are available for students who score highly at the interview stage. 

**The Depledge Lab currently participates in the following MHH graduate programs:**
  * **[DEWIN](https://www.mhh.de/en/hbrs/zib)**: The Infection Biology / Dynamics of Host-Pathogen Interactions Graduate Program is a 3-year PhD program focused on Infection Biology.

### Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Daniel Depledge](/contact). We are keen to support postdocs through the award of [Marie Sklodowska Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) and similar fellowships, where possible.
