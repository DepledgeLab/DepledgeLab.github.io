# Join the Depledge Lab
Our lab works at the intersection of molecular and computational virology and we are always looking for persons with expertise in one and/or the other. We welcome applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment.

We are always in the market for motivated and talented people, even if we do not have an open position currently advertised. We are interested in engaging with you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques. If interested please send your CV/Resume to [Daniel Depledge](/contact).

## Currently we have **open positions** for people with the following skills:
Bioinformatics/Computational Biology - MSc level or higher. Positions available are commensurate with experience. Please contact [Daniel Depledge](/contact) if you are interested

<!-- Currently we have **open positions** for people with the following skills:
[Specialist](https://aprecruit.ucsf.edu/JPF03325) who will engage in research projects and also manage daily wet lab operations. -->

## Master's students
We are proud to host students enrolled in the [MHH Biomedicine, Biomedical Data Science, and Infectious Disease + One Health (IDOH) programs](https://www.mhh.de/en/all-degree-programs) for both short (3-6 week) and long (up to 6 months) projects. If you are interested in discussing potential projects then please contact [Daniel Depledge](/contact).


## PhD Students

At the MHH, most PhD students are recruited via the DEWIN/ZIB (LINK) graduate program which offers a 3-year PhD program in which candidates who pass the interview stages are able to select from a set of projects submitted by group leaders from departments around the MHH. Scholarship awards (including DAAD(LINK)) are available for students who score highly at the interview stage. 

The commitment of the Depledge Lab to you durign your PhD studies is outlined in our [philosophy section](/philosophy)

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/programs) and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~3 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is usually open for rotation students every quarter and will generally have room for 1-2 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year.

 As the 3rd rotation period comes to a close, we will talk with the year's rotation students (at least those who remain interested!) about joining the lab.  During this period, we encourage students to keep talking to the PI and lab members about what kind of project they might want to shape. We consider project fit, scientific chemistry, and alignment with lab values. Because we are a member of multiple graduate programs with different policies and timings for final lab decision making, we cannot make any final commitments until the end of the Spring Quarter to ensure all rotations students are given consideration.

##### The Fraser Lab participates in the following UCSF graduate programs:
  * **[Biophysics](http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/)**: The Biophysics Graduate Program (BP) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to leverage new and emerging research tools—from nanotechnology to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy—to quantify biological processes in living biological systems using physics and chemistry.
  * **[Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://ccb.ucsf.edu/)**: The Chemistry and Chemical Biology Graduate Program (CCB) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to address problems at the intersection of chemistry and biology by providing a chemical foundation for understanding complex biological processes at an atomic level.
  * **[Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics](http://pspg.ucsf.edu/)**: The Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics (PSPG) Graduate Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) focuses on how to develop effective drug therapies for patients that have a minimum of adverse effects.
  * **[Tetrad](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)**: The Tetrad graduate program offers diverse training in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, & Genetics.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to [Daniel Depledge](/contact). We are keen to support postdocs through the award of [Marie Sklodowska Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship Program](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/actions/postdoctoral-fellowships) and similar fellowships, where possible.

## Other Visitors

In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac research specialists in the lab. We are open to other arrangements as well. If you are interested then please contact [Daniel Depledge](/contact).
